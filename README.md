This repository produces a portfolio webpage that acts as a portal for all of the projects that I have worked on.

## HTML and CSS techniques used to design the website
[HTML]
- Accessibility
- < form > Element
- id and href Attributes
- Semantic Elements

## UNC Bootcamp Acceptance Criteria
- Developer name and avatar presented in the top left hand corner of the header
- Navigational links within the header that scroll to the corresponding section
- Titled developer applications with supplemental images that increase in opacity as the user hovers over them
- The first application has the largest image and is self contained
- Subsequent applications are stacked in groups of two
- When the user selects one of the two live applications they are transitioned to the given website
- Responsive layout that adapts to the users viewport
